# Controller-search
This repo is basically a script to search how much work you or a group of people have done in the monoloth repo. 

## Usage
- This script will populate the results directory with csv files which then can be parsed into a spreadsheet by excel or google slides.
- To make this work with other names or with any other file type i.e Service files, change the regex patterns in `blameSecript.js` and `search.sh` respectively.

## Dependencies
Before running the `search.sh` bash script you will need to make sure you have git-extras installed on your machine. a quick `brew install git-extras` will work. Brew is only mac, id you are on windows find out a way install git-extras
